FLINT.Cloud Deployment
####################

This section guides you through the process of deploying FLINT.Cloud to
your own server, through a public cloud service provider. We use
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure to deploy FLINT.Cloud
APIs that are used by FLINT-specific applications, like FLINT-UI.
This guide assumes that you have some knowledge of the
concepts of GCP and Azure, and that you have successfully deployed an application before.
